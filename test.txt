Found this because it's the highest rated horror movie on IMDB. It's not really a scary horror movie, kind of more of a supernatural musical. It was funny. I liked it. Great singing.
Revisiting Manichitrathazhu even after 20 years of it hitting the theatres is justly for the utter respect the movie has generated over the years and the cult status it still fosters. Everything right from the one liners, humour, dialogues to even the back ground score still resonates in every Malayali's heart. An array of adaptations and remakes have followed but quite humbly a few of them were able to even live upto the name. I can with a lot of buoyancy claim that this movie laid a strong foundation for the semi-horror genre. The approach was quite prolific right from the introduction of characters to the tightly laid screenplay. Being a Malayali and essentially a movie buff, I can say I grew up in that ambience and has over a zillion times witnessed the movie's presence in diverse patterns. Let it be the intensely provoked dialogue of Shobhana or just the utterance of her name by Suresh Gopi, we have loved and treasured every bit of it through these years. From the tumbler falling and carelessly drifting across the floor to Shobhana's eyes curiously spanning the wooden frames, the movie still generates the chills down our spines and could easily outrun the modern day thrillers. The music is soulful and has cultivated an aura of the movie in each of its strands. Mohanlal as the male protagonist does a stupendous job and gives the character a unique shade that has just grown with time. The hilarious introduction scene or a silent observer outside the door while Shobhana is locked, Mohanlal executes it with sheer diligence. Nevertheless, the movie in its entirety belongs to Shobhana, the female protagonist. It would probably be unjust on me to comment on her performance but rather recommend witnessing the intensity by yourself, if you still haven't.  However, for the non Malayali's, I would definitely recommend a subtitled version, even though you may have seen those remakes or loosely adapted versions.
One of the best thrillers in Malayalam Cinema.
A Classic co-made by different directors under the supervision of Faazil. Also the most remade movie in different language, which were nowhere near the original.A must watch!
the besttt movie eva..... i can watch it a billion times n not get sick of it!!!!!
One of the best Malayalam movies from the 90's. Engrossing storyline, superb acting and directing. Now pretty much everybody in India has ripped off this movie and made craploads of money, but came nowhere close to the original in terms of quality.
This has got to be one of the best movies both in malayalam and in India. superb script combined with beautiful direction and acting has made this movie a treat to watch. I have watched this one numerous times..don't even remember the number. As many I was also disappointed to see its remake in other languages. I think they spoiled the beautiful concept and feel of this movie. Sobhana who got a National Award for this movie should have been given a second one after seeing the way other actress performed her role in those remakes.Its one of the dream movies which doesn't come very often...Perfect from all points of view - story, dialogues, performance, comedy, songs and direction..Please watch it if you haven't already.


The first half of Manichithrathazhu may be slow, but the second half becomes gripping. The amazing climax, featuring Shobana's spectacular dance with her partner, pushes this movie from a simple Malayalam thriller to the level of high art. Although the film isn't perfect--there are minor plot holes, and Mohanlal's entertaining performance goes over the top in some scenes--Manichithrathazhu is one of the best Indian movies I've seen.After watching this movie, I couldn't believe it was directed by Fazil, the same guy who churned out overly sentimental mush like Aniyathi Pravu (1997) and shameless, cookie-cutter Hollywood remakes like Life Is Beautiful (2000). Manichithrathazhu has to be the high point of Fazil's career.After a lifetime of avoiding most Malayalam movies like the plague, old classics like this film are turning me into a big fan of Malu films. Also, after watching his charismatic performances in films like Nadodikattu (1987), Pattana Pravesham (1988), Akkare akkare akkare (1990), and Manichithrathazhu, I find myself becoming an enthusiastic fan of Mohanlal. If you're not already a Mohanlal fan, watching Manichithrathazhu may make you one.


Manichitratazu is a very great Classical movie which I have ever seen. The portrayal of human psychology is marvelous. The movie plot is thrilling, mystic and powerful. Fantastic performances by all actors like Mohan Lal, Shobana, Vinaya Prasad, Suresh Gopi, Innocent, Nedumudi Venu, etc. Shobana's dancing skills is excellent and also good powerful acting by her and she rightfully deserves the national award. Not boring even if watched 3 -4 times. I am especially moved as to how the story writer has sketched this story. Really marvelous. He and the Director and the whole team deserves applause.


Its been some 14 years since I saw this movie, and recently I went out and bought it on DVD!I love the way they have mixed the settings of a large traditional Kerala household, the urban legends that I can totally identify with, and how its all presented with beautiful realism and how its been provided with a scientific explanation, and more interestingly how scientific approach branches out to use a traditional technique to suit the subject in question! Such an interesting and involving topic has been handled ever so skillfully throughout the movie with a subtle thread of contextual and refreshingly original comedy, which again, fits like a glove to the storytelling!This movie makes me proud of my Malayali tradition and background!


One Excellent masterpiece. This is one of the rare movies where the story can be interpreted in two ways. One way is to believe that Ganga is possessed by Nagavalli the dancer's spirit. The other is to assume that she is suffering from multiple personality disorder. The movie has arguments for both. The psychiatrist's explanations and predictions and his ability to solve the problem leaves most of the audience believing in the MCD theory. But Nagavalli fans point to the famous dance scene where Ganga's eyes change colour, and the scenes where she breaks objects like the clock which seemed quiet impossible to most. This reinforces the possession theory. Probably this is the first Indian movie to feature MCD. Highlights of the movie are the scene where Ganga gradually evolves into Nagavalli and her Malayalam changing into chaste Tamil, and the bharatanatyam dance sequence. It also has an unique song sung in a sad tone: 'pazham thamizh pattu'. Urban legends say the song's vaadi raga is unlucky, almost like gloomy Sunday and macbeth. Although made more than 13 years ago, it still glues you to the seat. two remakes were done on the movie. the kannada version was good though it didn't match the original. A tamil version was poor and twisted.
I was in high school when i saw it first in theater and now after 13 years i still enjoy this movie. I was very much disappointed when i saw it's remake which was far from the original work. Its filled with rubbish comedy scenes and awful performance of characters. Shobhana who won the national award for the role did an excellent performance. I know those who loves the remake will disagree me but you know what is the truth, don't you? I am not going to criticize the remake cause it may hurt someone's mind and i am also not interested in controversies anyway. If anybody is still there who didn't watch this movie please do it. This movie is worth watching, don't miss it!!!


This was one movie which really impressed me in 1993. Writing a review after so many years is a proof of how much sense it makes to me even today. Malayalam movies are always ahead of the rest of the country in making meaningful and realistic stories. That too on quarter of the budget a Bollywood movie is made with. This movie was a masterpiece work from Fazil. This movie also had another 6 A list directors doing diff segment of this movie, like the comedy part was done by Priyadashan. This movie was later made into a Tamil, Kannada and Telungu all which turned out to be super duper hits. Plans are in the pipeline to remake it in Hindi. But the essence of the movie is being lost in the translation. The 1993 Malayalam version is the best yet. This movie was well made and well received my all the generations of Keralites. A must watch if u like horror, thriller or friction movies.


This movie is a perfect mix of intelligent comedy and intense suspense. A superb climax which made my day when i saw this movie as a kid 10 years ago. The acting is excellent though i felt Mohanlal overdid some of his scenes. Easily one of the best movies Kerala has produced.


I have seen over 400 Indian films and nothing beats Manichitrathazhu. One of the most remade films in Indian cinema, Manichitrathazhu is a perfect combination of horror, psychological thriller and classical dance. All of the performances are great. Each scene is perfect. You can watch this film over and over again and discover something new with each viewing. It has been analyzed and re-analyzed for years and we still can't get enough of it. Even if you have seen some of the remakes like the Tamil Chandramukhi or Hindi Bhool Bhulaiyaa, please see the original Manichitrathazhu. You will enjoy it much more and realize why the original will always be the best. There was also a few sequels made like Kannada Apthamitra and Telugu Nagavalli. And there is a spin-off in Malayalam called Geethanjali. But like I said, nothing beats Manichitrathazhu. Get ready to be a fan!


One of the greatest thriller ever made in India & also among my most gratifying movie ever i had seen. No doubt story by Madhu muttam is the real hero & performance by all actors were magnificent especially Shobana(won national award). Shobana was scintillating & showcase a do or die performance. 1st half is enriched with comedy & little horror. 2nd half is nail biting taut thriller leads to fiery climax. There is no point in criticizing this masterpiece despite of its length. Music was both nostalgic & horrifying(climax). BGM by Johnson is brilliant which taken film to another dimension. Performance,Script,Music,Bgm,Cinematography,Direction,Make-up and Art department etc. were par excellence. Manichitrathazhu is one of the rare thriller which provide wholesome entertainment to the viewers in large quantity. There is no unnecessary scene and so its a 100% Impeccable masterpiece ever an Indian cinema produced. After premiering on T.V many times i never get bored watching again & again. Highly Recommended for thriller aficionado and also for avid moviegoers.=>MUST watch before die. =>Dont watch its remake version all were just mockery repercussion!I would like to rate it 9.5/10


Suresh Gopi returns to his native place along with his wife Shobana after a long time to meet his uncle Nedubudi Venu.They decide to stay in their family mansion which remains unoccupied owing to the fears of being haunted by an old dancer, Nagavalli.Nagavalli was murdered there by the king years ago for having an affair with another court singer.Shobana becomes fascinated on seeing the palace that she purposefully unlocks the room that had been once been the room of Nagavalli. Soon a series of ghostly events cut loose and fear begins to grip the family.Mohanlal acts the role of Dr.Sunny who comes to the aid of his buddy Suresh Gopi and solves the puzzle to discover there is more than what he had imagined to be solved.The movie offers an ideal comedy track from late Kuthiravattam Pappu, Innocent, Ganesh and Sudheesh. Mohanlal leaves a memorable mark. However the full credit goes to Shobana for her stupendous acting. This may be the best of Fazil movies and by far the best suspense thriller in history of malayalam cinema.For those thriller crazy maniacs, this is the ideal movie. Go grab ur copy of DVD for this evergreen classic.


Manichitrathazhu is that kind of a movie which will not bore you how many ever times you watch it. The direction and casting has been the highlight while the actors in the movie especially Shobana did a fantastic job for which she receive the National Awards for best actress. The movie is told in line with the culture and tradition of the place, Kerala and the rituals practiced there. Its a horror movie with a scientific view given to it and never got deviated from concept of science to a ghost movie. The movie maintains its pace and mentioned earlier, Shobana's work should be praised as it was at a different level, something which Indian cinema never ever witnessed till date. The director crafted each and every scene and characters so elegantly and wisely that every character contributed to the movie and every scene was relevant to the storyline. Its a must watch Indian movie of all time especially if you like the genres likes horror or suspense.


It is a well made movie with some excellent performances from Shobana, Mohanlal and others including Suresh Gopi, Innocent. The movie tries to touch our fears and empathies about Ghosts and such other superstitious beliefs which is prevalent all over India. The movie is a story of a woman from such a back ground and how it impacts her subconsciously leading to terrifying manifestations of dual character or multiple personality. The movie begins at lighter note with lot of humor and starts becoming more and more serious towards the end. The climax is one of the best things in the Movie. Shobana got a National award for the portrayal of this woman. Mohanlal has a strong presence and role in the movie. Humor element is added by Innocent. It is an quite engaging movie.


This is an excellent psycho thriller movie with elements of humor.I would recommend this movie to anyone.This movie is a must watch for all Malayalam movie lovers.My Rating - Can't give anything less than Perfect 10.


Manichitrathazhu (1993) :Brief Review -Manichitrathazhu expands the limits of Psychological-Horror-Thriller genre not only for Indian Cinema but also for Global Cinema. Suppose we are all in the year 1993, and try to understand this review as per the time and then you'll understand it perfectly and it won't even sound like an exaggeration. By 1993, Hollywood had One Classic Psychological thriller made, that's 'Silence Of The Lambs' (1991) and even that film does not have any unexpected revelations in the climax like Manichitrathazhu. Hollywood had stunning climaxes in Psychological Thriller genre with 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Fight Club' but these films came after 5-6 years of Manichitrathazhu. The same applies to Foreign Language Cinema (except for Bergman's Persona in 1966) and Indian Cinema. Just try to remember what kind of thrillers India was making or Hollywood was making by 1993 and then have a look at this Cult Classic Malayalam Flick. Manichitrathazhu truly is an pioneer of this new genre where horror elements are mixed up with Psychological Thrilling elements and the cumulative result of it leaves each an every viewer amazed, shocked, scared and boggled. What a cracking storyline it was for its time. Who would though of such a groundbreaking script then? I mean people were happy to see just a thriller or a psychological drama or a horror film and then Manichitrathazhu came up with a combined effects of all of them. OMG! There is not a single wrong thing in the film. The humour, the writing, the acting, the overwhelming ideas, stunning visuals, impeccable direction and what not. The film has been remade multiple times for a reason, right? Just prefer the original and this is certainly the Most Stunning Experience in the entire 90s decade. A cinematic sensation beyond filmmaking limits of contemporary global cinema.RATING - 8.5/10*By - #samthebestest.


RATED 8/10Language: MalayalamSource: Amazon PrimeRECOMMENDEDSuperb thriller drama but bit slow pace... And one more time it proves that originals are always better. The logic and characters are so much better and logical in this one... The pure and artistic form of "Chandramukhi". I liked each and every character and their acting...Must watch drama..


Such great performances! More real and believable than the Hindi remake Bhool Bhulaiyaa but I must admit I enjoyed Bhool Bhulaiyaa more than Manichitrathazhu because -1. The story was new for me so while watching Manichitrathazhu there's no suspense.2. I was able to appreciate when they used Bengali but in Manichitrathazhu when they used Tamil I was not able to appreciate it because to me Malayalam & Tamil sounds similar.3. The comedy in Manichitrathazhu is subtle & I enjoy Priyadarshan-Akshay style more. (or maybe it's just the language barrier)I think I have seen Bhool Bhulaiyaa far too many times to the point I remember all characters' name & dialogues. What to do they used to play it every week on TV.P.S. Mohanlal's shirts are awesome in Manichitrathazhu.


An amazing psychological thriller and the best movie of the century. The humors introduced between the story makes it more colorful. I watched this movie for the first time when I was a kid and have watched it over a 100 times till now. I bet no movie can beat it in future. All the actors have given their best, totally dedicated to their respective roles. It was indeed the turning point for the malayalam film industry. No matter what this movie cannot be recreated and any attempt to compete with this movie would be a waste of time.This movie impressed and was applauded by the entire country and hence it was remade in almost all other languages.
The story of this movie is very unique and has not been told before. First we thought it is a supernatural story, but as we understood the dual personality of Shobhana we got very interested in this character and how she would be able to get out of her predicament. The characters in the movie, Sunny Joseph, Nakulan, Ganga, Ammavan are all memorable and have been portrayed with realism.Even though this is a ghost movie, there are no special effects. Director Fazil uses simple tricks like shadows on the wall and sounds to heighten the tension. In one scene, the whole family goes to watch a Kathakali performance. Sunny sits in the front and occasionally turns back to see if Ganga is alright. The sound of the drums heighten in the background. Then, once when Sunny turns back, there is silence and Ganga is not there. The intensity of the scene is heightened by the lack of any background sound, which we thought was a very innovative but subtle technique.In this movie, the script by Madhu Mattom is the hero and Shobhana is the heroine. Shobhana had two roles, one as the mild mannered Ganga and the other as the revenge seeking Nagavalli. It during the Nagavalli phase that you see her transformation, in her voice and in her mannerism. Shobhana won a truly deserved National Award for this role.Mohanlal makes his entry just before the interval, which is unconventional. From that point onwards, it is his show and the character he portrays is that of a fun loving psychiatrist. He is unconventional in his treatment style also. Mohanlal does not have much histrionics in this movie and plays a very subdued role.For a movie which is a psycho-thriller, it has excellent comedy provided by Innocent, Lalitha and Mohanlal himself.The story, screenplay and dialogue is by Madhu Mattom and we liked all three of them. There are no unnecessary scenes in this movie and each scene in the screenplay sustains our interest in the story. We also are impressed by the craft of director Fazil for making this movie very interesting. The movie also had a second unit by directors Sathyan Antikkad and Priyadarshan. M.G.Radhakrishnan has provided some memorable music for this movie. All the songs are nice to hear, but our favourite is Palavattom Pookalam This movie is one of our favourites and is a must watch.
Hi friends,This is an all-time classic.A well made movie given attention to every single detail.The direction and storyline are excellent.But the highlight is the acting of Mohanlal and Shobhana.Very contrasting characters.They have made these characters immortal.All the people who see this movie will understand what great actors Mohanlal and Shobhana are.Seen this movie about 20 times and still enjoys the movie.Friends,if you are a Keralite,you certainly would have seen this movie by now.Others,please,if you love good movies and if u haven't seen this movie by now,try 2 get this movie somehow,with subtitles if u don't understand MalayalamAnd there is another thing i have to tell.it's to those stupid people who r trying 2 remake this movie.They have made2 attempts by now.I have seen one,Chandramukhi in Tamil by Rajnikanth.And it was utter bullshit.I have given a rating of 10 for this movie.Then,that for it's Tamil remake would be about 0.


Don't consider this movie as a horror movie. It is a psychological thriller.
This is the best commercial movie i have seen in so many years.still keeps me hooked when i see this movie because of the freshness of the subject.i have seen all the remade versions of this movie.needful to say all were craps and this still remains to be fresh,solid,scintillating,brisk because all the technicians and artists who worked in this movie gave their best and memorable performances to make this movie the best among commercial movies.Mohanlal,probably the greatest actor India has ever delivered, gives out a splendid performance as always by rightly knowing his potentials.you ll know why he is a such a best natural actor when you look at the mannerisms and gimmicks he gives in this movie which he does throughout the movie without going out of the character.Suresh Gopi has given a memorable performance as a hapless husband especially he delivers his best when he comes to know that his wife is the exact psychologically disturbed person.truly amazing.Nedumudi Venu,Innocent,K.P.A.C. Lalitha,Sudheesh,Vinaya Prasad,Pappu,Ganesh Kumar and of course Thilakan every one have given memorable performances,but easily the scene stealer is Shobana.she delivers one of her best performances to date for which she got a very well deserved national award.be it a naive Ganga or the ruthless nagavalli she is there to deliver the best.really amazing to watch her performance throughout the movie.kudos to her.finally The hit maker.it is none other than our very own Fazil who gives this movie its true colors along with Madhu Muttam and his crew.only he could have pulled this film in this form of being fun filled,yet intricate.brilliant.finally,this is the best commercial movie of all time and a movie which should be cherished in each and every malayali's DVD library.


This film created waves among India and won many awards.In this psychological thriller a couple comes to their ancestoral home which is bounded by a big family and surrounded by mysterious beliefs.But to the couples  surprise they themselves experience strange things such as someone throwing plates and clocks etc from vaccum. This leads to Suresh Gopi's friend mohanlal who is a psychatrist forced t come to solve this issue and the most unbelievable secrets are found .He experiences some female's sound who was beleived to be dead .He follows these sounds to find the secrets.The climax is the most best part in the film and the most horrifying one.


Don't remember how many times I have watched this movie. But when it comes in television I watch this without boredom. Such a masterpiece story and making. Hats off to faasil - director. If i am asked to pick 5 best malayalam movies ever, manichithrathazhu will surely be on that list.Absolute Class👌


This a must watch movie what ever the language it doesn't matter. So many remakes are filmed in various languages. But this one, the original stands above all of them. No words to describe the movie.
